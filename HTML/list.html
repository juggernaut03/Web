  </h1>
  <hr>
  <h2>Ingredents:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup basmati rice</li>
    <li>1/2 cup yellow moong dal (split yellow mung beans)</li>
    <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 small tomato, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 small potato, peeled and diced (optional)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, beans, cauliflower), diced</li>
    <li>1-inch piece of ginger, grated</li>
    <li>2-3 cloves of garlic, minced (optional)</li>
    <li>2 green chilies, slit lengthwise</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>3 cups water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) or oil</li>
    <li>Fresh coriander leaves for garnish</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Rinse the rice and moong dal separately under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak them in water for about 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
  <li>Heat ghee or oil in a pressure cooker or a deep pot over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
  <li>Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent.</li>
  <li>Add grated ginger, minced garlic, and slit green chilies. Sauté for a minute until the raw aroma disappears.</li>
  <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn soft and mushy.</li>
  <li>Add the diced vegetables and potato (if using). Stir well to combine.</li>
  <li>Drain the soaked rice and dal and add them to the pot. Stir to mix with the vegetables.</li>
  <li>Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well.</li>
  <li>Pour water into the pot and stir to combine everything.</li>
  <li>If using a pressure cooker, close the lid and cook on medium heat for 3-4 whistles. If using a pot, cover with a lid and cook on medium-low heat until the rice and dal are soft and mushy, stirring occasionally. Add more water if needed.</li>
  <li>Once cooked, let the pressure release naturally before opening the lid.</li>
  <li>Give the khichdi a gentle stir. If it's too thick, you can add some hot water to adjust the consistency.</li>
  <li>Serve hot garnished with fresh coriander leaves. Khichdi pairs well with yogurt, pickle, or papad. Enjoy your comforting and nutritious meal!</li>
